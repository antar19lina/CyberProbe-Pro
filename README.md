**CloudGuard** is a cloud-native security automation platform designed to perform automated web application and infrastructure security assessments in cloud environments.

It enables:

- Automated vulnerability detection
- Security header analysis
- Risk-based classification
- Structured executive reporting
- AWS-integrated deployment

CloudGuard is built using secure-by-design principles and follows modular, scalable architecture suitable for DevSecOps workflows and SOC environments.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Modern cloud deployments require continuous security validation.  
Manual testing is slow, inconsistent, and not scalable.

Organizations need:

- Automated cloud security scanning
- Structured risk reporting
- Secure cloud integration
- Containerized deployment
- Scalable scanning architecture

CloudGuard addresses these challenges through automated pentesting orchestration.
